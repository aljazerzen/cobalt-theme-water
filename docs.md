## Documentation

Welcome to the Cobalt docs! Here begins a majestic journey that will
take us from installation to deployment, and everywhere in between.

### Table of Contents

To the left, you will find a basic table of contents.
For your convenience, you can find this on every docs page.

### Bugs

Just like our code, our docs can have bugs. If you notice a typo, omission,
grammatical error, or any other bug, please feel free to head over to
[https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-org.github.io](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-org.github.io)
and open an issue and we&rsquo;ll be happy to fix it.

If you feel like contributing further, you can fork that repo,
branch from `source`, and submit a pull request.
Contributions are always welcome!
