# A minimal [cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs) website demo

This repo uses [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) and a few liquid templates to generate a static website with Cobalt. The content was taken from (cobalt-org.github.io)[https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-org.github.io], but it can easily be replaced with your own markdown files.

You can see [the showcase](https://aljazerzen.github.io/cobalt-theme-water), which also contains instructions on how to get started with Cobalt.
